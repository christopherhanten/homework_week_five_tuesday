So, another day, another excuse:(</br>
  While, I do feel good and excited about working with databases, and I felt pretty good with Mongo, I sicked in the public bathroom and had to go home. Therefore, I missed out on Mongoose in the post-lunch and the lab. I tried to follow the instructions for the lab on my own, and don't feel like it was t-t-t-terrible. I didn't get it set up properly.

  I am mad at me.
